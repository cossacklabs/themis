# ⏱ Themis Core benchmarks

## Quickstart

Themis Core benchmarks are written using [**Criterion.rs**](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/criterion_rs.html) statistical benchmarking tool.

You will need Rust toolchain installed to run benchmarks.
[Visit rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) to install Rust.

 1. 📦 **Install Themis Core**

    Benchmarks use Themis library from the system by default.
    <!-- TODO: use local builds if available -->

    Normally, this should be enough to install Themis:

    ```bash
    make install
    ```

    If it doesn’t work (or this is your first time building Themis)
    then you might need to [review the documentation](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/documentation-themis/#building-and-installing).

    If it still doesn’t work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/issues/new?labels=bug,installation,core&template=bug_report.md&title=).

 2. ⚙️ **Change directory from repository root**

    ```bash
    cd benches/themis
    ```

    It’s not required but you would have to type less.

 3. ⏳ **Build dependencies**

    ```bash
    cargo bench --no-run
    ```

    Criterion.rs has quite a few dependencies so be patient,
    you need to do this only once.

 4. 🚀 **Run some benchmarks**

    ```bash
    cargo bench -- "Secure Cell .* Seal, master key/64 KB"
    ```

    [See FAQ](#faq) for more information on how and what you can run.

 5. 📊 **Analyze result report**

    ```bash
    open target/criterion/report/index.html
    ```

    Done! 🎉

## FAQ

First of all, it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with
[Criterion.rs User Guide](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/criterion_rs.html),
especially sections on
[command-line options](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/user_guide/command_line_options.html),
[output format](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/user_guide/command_line_output.html),
and [interpreting results](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/analysis.html).

**Q:** What benchmarks are available?

```bash
cargo bench -- --list
```

**Q:** How do I run one of them?

```bash
cargo bench -- 'one of them'    # filter by regular expression
```

**Q:** How do I see if my optimizations have an effect?

```bash
git checkout feature
cargo bench -- --save-baseline feature-unoptimized

git checkout optimizations
# Work on performance
# ...

# Compare against the baseline version
cargo bench -- --baseline feature-unoptimized
```

Don’t forget to _reinstall_ Themis Core library every time you make a change in it and want to measure it.
<!-- TODO: and to pester maintainers to support local builds -->

**Q:** Benchmarking takes ages, what can I do?

```bash
cargo bench -- --sample-size 20     # cannot be lower than 10
```
