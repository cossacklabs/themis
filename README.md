#### Crypto library for storage and messaging for Swift, Obj-C, Android, Desktop Java, –°++, Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust.
<br>

Themis is an open-source high-level cryptographic services library for mobile and server platforms, which provides secure data exchange and storage.

Themis provides four important cryptographic services:

* **[Secure Cell](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Secure-Cell-cryptosystem)**: a multi-mode cryptographic container suitable for storing anything from encrypted files to database records and format-preserved strings. Secure Cell is built around AES-256 in GCM (Token and Seal modes) and CTR (Context imprint mode).
* **[Secure Message](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Secure-Message-cryptosystem)**: a simple encrypted messaging solution for the widest scope of applications. Exchange the keys between the parties and you're good to go. Two pairs of the underlying crytosystems: ECC + ECDSA / RSA + PSS + PKCS#7. 
* **[Secure Session](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Secure-Session-cryptosystem)**: session-oriented, forward secrecy datagram exchange solution with better security guarantees, but more demanding infrastructure. Secure Session can perfectly function as socket encryption, session security, or (with some additional infrastructure) as a high-level messaging primitive. ECDH key agreement, ECC & AES encryption.
* **[Secure Comparator](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Secure-Comparator-cryptosystem)**: a Zero-Knowledge based cryptographic protocol for authentication and comparing secrets.

**Want to go straight to the detailed documentation?** [Please proceed here](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/documentation-themis/#start-here). 

We created Themis to build other products on top of it - i.e. [Acra](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra) and [Hermes](https://github.com/cossacklabs/hermes-core).

Themis works on most operating systems (see [Availability](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis#availability)) and is available for [Swift (iOS, macOS)](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/swift-howto/), [Objective-C (iOS, macOS)](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/objective-c-howto/), [Java desktop and Android](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/java-and-android-howto/), [Ruby](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/ruby-howto/),  [Python](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/python-howto/), 
[PHP](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/php-howto/), 
[C++](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/cpp-howto/), 
[Node.js](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/nodejs-howto/), [Go](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/go-howto/), [Rust](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/rust-howto/),
[Google Chrome](https://github.com/cossacklabs/webthemis). 

We're also porting Themis features to different environments where people might need them: [Redis module](https://www.github.com/cossacklabs/rd_themis), [PostgreSQL module](https://www.github.com/cossacklabs/pg_themis)

Themis was designed to provide complicated cryptosystems in an easy-to-use infrastructure, with modern rapid development in mind:

* **EASY**: Themis does not require users to obsess over parameters, cipher combination, and yet it provides high levels of security.
* **DO YOUR THING**: Themis allows developers to focus on doing the necessary: developing their applications. 
* **BEST PRACTICE**: Themis is based on the best modern practices in implementing complicated security systems.

Themis relies on [the best available](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Cryptographic-donors) open-source implementations of cryptographic primitives (ciphers). 

Themis is open source, Apache 2 Licensed. 

# Quickstart

TODO: update links

## Install from package managers

The easiest way to install Themis is [to use package repositories for your OS and language](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/documentation-themis/#getting-themis). Package repositories contain the stable versions of Themis, prebuilt and packaged for the most widely-used systems. Each supported platform has 

Installation for server-side platforms (like Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, macOS) consists of two parts: installing Themis Core library into system and installing Themis language wrapper to use from your application. Refer to [the Installation guide](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/documentation-themis/#getting-themis).

Installation for mobile platforms (iOS, Android) is easier: just use package manager popular at this platform. Refer to [the Installation guide](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/documentation-themis/#getting-themis).

## Install from sources

If you need the latest development version of Themis, or your system is not supported yet, you can [build and install Themis from GitHub source code](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/documentation-themis/#getting-themis).

As long as it remains feasible, we'll be accumulating the list of all our tutorials on how to use Themis in different cases here:

* [Building end-to-end encrypted Firebase-based application](https://github.com/vixentael/zka-example) for note sharing: build bullet-proof application even when using backend-as-a-service which can't be fully trusted.

* [Key management basics for iOS](https://github.com/vixentael/ios-datasec-basics) shows numerous ways how to store keys (API tokens, user passwords) using obfuscation and encryption techniques.

* [Releasing Themis into public: usability testing](https://www.cossacklabs.com/02-usability-testing.html), which goes a bit into how to use Secure Message for iOS and Python. Go directly into [corresponding GitHub repository](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis-ux-testing) to play with code.

# Themis Server

If you'd like to experiment with Themis in a more interactive environment, check out [Themis Server](https://themis.cossacklabs.com), interactive debugging environment for Themis. Themis Server can verify and decrypt code encrypted by Secure Cell or Secure Message, and provides a fully-functional backend for Secure Session. Examples for many languages are available in [docs/examples/Themis-server](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/Themis-server).
