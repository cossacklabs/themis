#### Crypto library for storage and messaging for Swift, Obj-C, Android/Java, –°++, JS, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go.
<br>

Themis is an open-source high-level cryptographic services library for mobile and server platforms, which provides secure data exchange and storage. The current stable release is [0.10.0](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/releases/tag/0.10.0), dated 6th of February 2018.

**Important:** If you're upgrading from Themis 0.9.6 or earlier, please see the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Migration-guide). 

Themis provides four important cryptographic services:

* **[Secure Message](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Secure-Message-cryptosystem)**: a simple encrypted messaging solution for the widest scope of applications. Exchange the keys between the parties and you're good to go. Two pairs of the underlying crytosystems: ECC + ECDSA / RSA + PSS + PKCS#7. 
* **[Secure Session](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Secure-Session-cryptosystem)**: session-oriented, forward secrecy datagram exchange solution with better security guarantees, but more demanding infrastructure. Secure Session can perfectly function as socket encryption, session security, or (with some additional infrastructure) as a high-level messaging primitive. ECDH key agreement, ECC & AES encryption.
* **[Secure Cell](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Secure-Cell-cryptosystem)**: a multi-mode cryptographic container suitable for storing anything from encrypted files to database records and format-preserved strings. Secure Cell is built around AES in GCM (Token and Seal modes) and CTR (Context imprint mode).
* **[Secure Comparator](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Secure-Comparator-cryptosystem)**: a Zero-Knowledge based cryptographic protocol for authentication and comparing secrets.

**Want to go straight to the detailed documentation?** [Please proceed here](https://www.github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki). 

We created Themis to build other products on top of it - i.e. [Acra](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra) and [Hermes](https://github.com/cossacklabs/hermes-core).

Themis works on most operating systems (see [Availability](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis#availability)) and is available for [Swift (iOS, macOS)](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Swift-Howto), [Objective-C (iOS, macOS)](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Objective-C-Howto), [Java+Android](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Java-and-Android-Howto),  [Ruby](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Ruby-Howto),  [Python](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Python-Howto), 
[PHP](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/PHP-Howto), 
[C++](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/CPP-Howto), 
[Javascript (NodeJS)](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/NodeJS-Howto), [Go](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Go-HowTo),
[Google Chrome](https://github.com/cossacklabs/webthemis). 

We're also porting Themis features to different environments where people might need them: [Redis module](https://www.github.com/cossacklabs/rd_themis), [PostgreSQL module](https://www.github.com/cossacklabs/pg_themis)

Themis was designed to provide complicated cryptosystems in an easy-to-use infrastructure, with modern rapid development in mind:

* **EASY**: Themis does not require users to obsess over parameters, cipher combination, and yet it provides high levels of security.
* **DO YOUR THING**: Themis allows developers to focus on doing the necessary: developing their applications. 
* **BEST PRACTICE**: Themis is based on the best modern practices in implementing complicated security systems.

Themis relies on [the best available](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Cryptographic-donors) open-source implementations of cryptographic primitives (ciphers). 

Themis is open source, Apache 2 Licensed. 

# Quickstart

## Install Themis from Cossack Labs repository

### Debian / Ubuntu

**1. Import the public key used by Cossack Labs to sign packages:**
```console
wget -qO - https://pkgs.cossacklabs.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
> Note: If you wish to validate key fingerprint, it is: `29CF C579 AD90 8838 3E37 A8FA CE53 BCCA C8FF FACB`.

**2. You may need to install the apt-transport-https package before proceeding:**
```console
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
```
**3. Add Cossack Labs repository to your `sources.list`.**
You should add a line that specifies your OS name and the release name:
```console
deb https://pkgs.cossacklabs.com/stable/$OS $RELEASE main
```
* `$OS` should be `debian` or `ubuntu`.
* `$RELEASE` should be one of Debian or Ubuntu release names. You can determine this by running `lsb_release -cs`, if you have `lsb_release` installed.

We currently build packages for the following OSs and RELEASE combinations:

- *Debian "Wheezy" (Debian 7)*,
- *Debian "Jessie" (Debian 8)*,
- *Debian "Stretch" (Debian 9)*,
- *Ubuntu Trusty Tahr (Ubuntu 14.04)*,
- *Ubuntu Xenial Xerus (Ubuntu 16.04)*,
- *Ubuntu Artful Aardvark (Ubuntu 17.10)*.

For example, if you are running *Debian 9 "Stretch"*, run:

```console
echo "deb https://pkgs.cossacklabs.com/stable/debian stretch main" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cossacklabs.list
```
**4. Reload local package database:**
```console
sudo apt-get update
```
**5. Install the package**
```console
sudo apt-get install libthemis
```

### CentOS / RHEL / OEL

> Note: We only build RPM packages for x86_64.

**1. Import the public key used by Cossack Labs to sign packages:**

```console
sudo rpm --import https://pkgs.cossacklabs.com/gpg
```
> Note: If you wish to validate key fingerprint, it is: `29CF C579 AD90 8838 3E37 A8FA CE53 BCCA C8FF FACB`.

**2. Create a Yum repository file for Cossack Labs package repository:**

```console
wget -qO - https://pkgs.cossacklabs.com/stable/centos/cossacklabs.repo | \
  sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/cossacklabs.repo
```
**3. Install the package:**

```console
sudo yum install libthemis
```

That's all! Themis is ready to use. The easiest way is to follow one of the tutorials and examples provided below.

## Install Themis from GitHub

1. Fetch the repository: git clone https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis.git.
2. Make sure OpenSSL/LibreSSL + OpenSSL/LibreSSL Dev package (libssl-dev) are installed at typical paths: `/usr/lib`, `/usr/include` (`/usr/local/*` for macOS). 
3. Make sure the typical GCC/clang environment is installed.
4. Type 'make install' and you're done (in most of the cases).
5. Visit [our wiki](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki) for the documentation specific to your language of choice and take a look at docs/examples for examples. 

It is a really good idea to [go and read the docs after installing Themis](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/Building-and-installing), but we realise that Fortune favours the brave. Remember that you're always welcome in the [documentation Wiki](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki).
