## What Themis is

Themis is an open-source high-level cryptographic services library for securing data during authentication, storage, messaging, network exchange, etc. Themis solves 90% of typical data protection use cases that are common for most apps. 

Themis helps to build both simple and complex cryptographic features easily, quickly, and securely. Themis allows developers to focus on the main thing: developing their applications.

## Use cases that Themis solves

* **Encrypt stored secrets** in your apps and backend: API keys, session tokens, files.

* **Encrypt sensitive data fields** before storing in database (_"application-side field-level encryption"_).

* Support **searchable encryption**, data tokenisation and data masking using Themis and [Acra](https://www.cossacklabs.com/acra/).

* Exchange secrets securely: **share sensitive data** between parties, build simple chat app between patients and doctors.

* Build **end-to-end encryption schemes** with centralised or decentralised architecture: encrypt data locally on one app, use it encrypted everywhere, decrypt only for authenticated user.

* Maintain **real-time secure sessions**: send encrypted messages to control connected devices from your app, receive real-time sensitive data from your apps to your backend.

* **Compare secrets** between parties without revealing them (zero-knowledge proof-based authentication).

* **One cryptographic library that fits them all**: Themis is the best fit for multi-platform apps (e.g., iOS+Android+Electron app with Node.js backend) because it provides 100% compatible API and works in the same way across all supported platforms.


## Cryptosystems

Themis provides ready-made building blocks *([‚Äúcryptosystems‚Äù](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/themis/#cryptosystems))* which simplify usage of core cryptographic security operations.

Themis provides 4 important cryptographic services:

* **[Secure Cell](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/themis/crypto-theory/cryptosystems/secure-cell/)**: a multi-mode cryptographic container suitable for **storing anything** from encrypted files to database records and format-preserved strings. Secure Cell is built around AES-256-GCM, AES-256-CTR.
* **[Secure Message](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/themis/crypto-theory/cryptosystems/secure-message/)**: a simple **encrypted messaging** solution for the widest scope of applications. Exchange the keys between the parties and you're good to go. Two pairs of underlying cryptosystems: ECC + ECDSA / RSA + PSS + PKCS#7.
* **[Secure Session](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/themis/crypto-theory/cryptosystems/secure-session/)**: **session-oriented encrypted data exchange** with forward secrecy for better security guarantees and more demanding infrastructures. Secure Session can perfectly function as socket encryption, session security, or a high-level messaging primitive (with some additional infrastructure like PKI). ECDH key agreement, ECC & AES encryption.
* **[Secure Comparator](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/themis/crypto-theory/cryptosystems/secure-comparator/)**: Zero knowledge proofs-based cryptographic protocol for **authentication** and comparing secrets.

We created Themis to build other products on top of it - i.e. [Acra](https://www.cossacklabs.com/acra/) and [Hermes](https://www.cossacklabs.com/hermes/).

# Installation

# Cryptography

Themis relies on proven cryptographic algorithms implemented by well-known cryptography libraries such as OpenSSL, LibreSSL, BoringSSL. Refer to [Cryptograhy in Themis](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/themis/crypto-theory/) docs to learn more.

# Submitting apps to the App Store

If your application uses Themis and you want to submit it to the Apple App Store, there are certain requirements towards declaring use of any cryptography.

Read about [Apple export regulations on cryptography for Themis](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/themis/regulations/apple-crypto-regulations/) to find out what to do.

# Security

Each change in Themis core library is being reviewed and approved by our internal team of cryptographers and security engineers. For every release, we perform internal audits by cryptographers who don't work on Themis.

We use a lot of automated security testing, i.e. static code analysers, fuzzing tools, memory analysers, unit tests (per each platform), integration tests (to find compatibility issues between different Themis-supported languages, OS and x86/x64 architectures). Read more about our security testing practices in [Themis security docs](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/themis/security/).

If you believe that you've found a security-related issue, please drop us an email to [dev@cossacklabs.com](mailto:dev@cossacklabs.com). Bug bounty program may apply.

# GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA  

As a cryptographic services library for mobile and server platforms, Themis is a ["state of the art"](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-32-gdpr/) encryption tool, which provides secure data exchange and storage. 

Using Themis, you can reach better compliance with the current data privacy regulations, such as:     
* [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/)
