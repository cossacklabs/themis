# Starting with Themis 0.14 we don't have any need for this config anymore
# since Themis has migrated away from CircleCI. However, until Themis 0.14
# is released, CircleCI still runs nightly builds on the "stable" branch
# and it requires the ".circleci/config.yml" file on the "master" branch.
# Here's a minimal file contaning only required keys and doing no jobs.
