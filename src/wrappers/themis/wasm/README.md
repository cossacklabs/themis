## Getting started

### Installation

Start by installing the latest version of WasmThemis:

```
npm install wasm-themis
```

Import it into your project:

```javascript
const themis = require('wasm-themis')
```

Wait for WebAssembly code to load:

```javascript
themis.initialized.then(function() {
    //
    // Now you can use "themis" functions
    //
})
```
Success!
