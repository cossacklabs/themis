// just "initialized" promise which is resolved once WASM code is downloaded
// and compiled. User code is expected to await for that promise to resolve,
// then proceed using WasmThemis functions.
//
// Back in the day, WasmThemis was not modularized, so the download & compile
// was initiated immediately once JS code of WasmThemis got loaded and the
// module was evaluated.
//
// Obviously, there is no way to pass any parameters to this promise either.
//
// In order to keep "initialized" working, we do some trickery, exporting
// a promise that will make sure that initialize() is called before this
// promise is resolved. This kickstarts WebAssmebly loading and ensures
// that WasmThemis is initialized once "initialized" promise is resolved.
//
// This approach does not cover the case where the user code does not use
// "initialized" promise at all. That is, if the application just hopes
// that WasmThemis is loaded by the time it's needed. This should be rare.
// Users have been warned.

// TypeScript does not allow to extend Promise nicely in ES5 [1], but since
// JavaScript is actually duck-typed, we can just mimick the API.
