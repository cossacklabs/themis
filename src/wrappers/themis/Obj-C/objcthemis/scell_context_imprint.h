/**
 * Secure Cell in Context Imprint mode.
 *
 * Context Imprint mode is intended for environments where storage constraints
 * do not allow the size of the data to grow and there is no auxiliary storage
 * available. Context Imprint mode requires an additional "associated context"
 * to be provided along with the secret in order to protect the data.
 *
 * In Context Imprint mode no authentication token is computed or verified.
 * This means the integrity of the data is not enforced, so the overall
 * security level is slightly lower than in Seal or Token Protect modes.
 *
 * @note To ensure highest security level possible, supply a different
 * associated context for each encryption invocation with the same secret.
 *
 * Read more about Context Imprint mode:
 *
 * https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/secure-cell-cryptosystem/#context-imprint-mode

 * during decryption. Usually this is some plaintext data associated with encrypted data,
