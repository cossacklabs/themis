/**
 * Themis Secure Cell.
 *
 * Secure Ð¡ell is a high-level cryptographic service, aimed to protect arbitrary
 * data being stored in various types of storages (like databases, filesystem
 * files, document archives, cloud storage etc). It provides a simple way to
 * secure your data using strong encryption and data authentication mechanisms,
 * with easy-to-use interfaces for broad range of use-cases.
 *
 * Implementing secure storage is often constrained by various practical
 * matters - ability to store keys, existence of length-sensitive code
 * bound to database structure, requirements to preserve structure. To cover
 * a broader range of usage scenarios and provide highest security level for
 * systems with such constraints, we've designed several types of interfaces
 * and implementations of secure data container, Secure Cell. They slightly
 * differ in overall security level and ease of use: more complicated and
 * slightly less secure ones can cover more constrained environments though.
 * Interfaces below are prioritized by our preference, which takes only
 * security and ease of use into account.
 *
 * - @c TSCellSeal is the most secure and the easiest one to use.
 *
 * - @c TSCellToken is able to preserve the encrypted data length
 *   but requires separate data storage to be available.
 *
 * - @c TSCellContextImprint preserves encrypted data length too,
 *   but at a cost of slightly lower security and more involved
 *   interface.
 *
 * @note This @c TSCell is a base class of Secure Cells. You need to select
 * one of the subclasses implementing a particular mode.
 *
