/** @brief Base Secure cell interface
*
* Secure Ð¡ell is a high-level cryptographic service, aimed to protect arbitrary data being stored in various types of
* storages (like databases, filesystem files, document archives, cloud storage etc).
* It provides a simple way to secure your data using strong encryption and data authentication mechanisms,
* with easy-to-use interfaces for broad range of use-cases.
*
*  Implementing secure storage is often constrained by various practical matters - ability to store keys,
* existence of length-sensitive code bound to database structure, requirements to preserve structure.
* To cover a broader range of usage scenarios and provide highest security level for systems with such constraints,
* we've designed several types of interfaces and implementations of secure data container, Secure Cell.
* They slightly differ in overall security level and ease of use: more complicated and slightly less secure ones can
* cover more constrained environments though. Interfaces below are prioritized by our preference,
* which takes only security and ease of use into account.
