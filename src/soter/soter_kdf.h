 * @param [in]  salt                additional salt for derivation, may be NULL

 *
 * This function derives a key from a passphrase using a salt and iteration
 * count as specified in RFC 8018. It uses HMAC-SHA-256 as the hash function.
 *
 * The iteration count must be a positive number. The bigger it is, the slower
 * the derivation, and the harder it gets for an attacker to perform a brute
 * force attack with candidate passphrases. RFC 8018 suggests at least 1000.
 * We suggest using at least 100,000. Generally, you experiment with values,
 * use the biggest one that you can tolerate.
 *
 * It is a good idea to periodically reevaluate your decision and increase
 * the iteration count as machines get faster. However, doing this results
 * in a different key being derived so you'd need to reencrypt data protected
 * by the previous key.
 *
 * @returns SOTER_SUCCESS on successful key derivation.
 *
 * @exception SOTER_FAIL on critical backend failure.
 *
 * @exception SOTER_INVALID_PARAM if `passphrase` is NULL or `passphrase_length` is zero.
 * @exception SOTER_INVALID_PARAM if `salt` is NULL but `salt_length` is not zero.
 * @exception SOTER_INVALID_PARAM if `iterations` count is zero.
 * @exception SOTER_INVALID_PARAM if `key` is NULL or `key_length` is zero.
